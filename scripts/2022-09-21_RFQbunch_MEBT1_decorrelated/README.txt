Tracking from start to HZ04 using RFQ simulation as input. 10M particles.

Beam current is 42 mA; stored full beam coordinate array at each quad (QV01, QH02, QV03, QH04) and at HZ04 and the initial bunch. 

Removed cross-plane correlations from the bunch before tracking to see if these affect hollowing observed at HZ04.
